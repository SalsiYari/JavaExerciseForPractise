    /*
    * Define two classes, namely Circle and Rectangle representing a circle and rectangle on a 2D plane.

Circle internally uses a Point object and a double value for representing its center and radius.
Rectangle internally uses two Point objects for representing its upper-left and bottom-right vertices. The edges of the rectangle have to be parallel to the x and y axes.
Both shapes must also support:

an id (String) for identifying the shape
a color (String) for coloring the shape (RGB Web Standard #RRGGBB, see https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Web_colors)
the capability of moving on the 2D plane (move() method)
the capability of resizing (resize() method)
the capability of computing area and perimeter (getArea(), getPerimeter() methods)
Refer to the UML diagram, JavaDoc documentation, and unit tests for further inspiration.*/
